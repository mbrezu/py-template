# Python Template

This is a very basic template for a new Python project.

What it gives you:

 * `init.sh` - script to initialize a virtual environment,
 * `source activate.sh` - script to activate the virtual environment (will look for and source `activate`),
 * `install.sh` and `requirements.txt` - script to download the required packages and
 * a `.gitignore` file.
